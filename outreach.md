Hi, Name,

I hope your day is going amazing! I came across your job posting! Before I apply to the black resume hole I wanted to see if you would get a referral bonus as an internal employee? In the event that you do, I have attached my resume. I would be so grateful if you could get it in the right hands.

Thanks again for your time and please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you out as well.

Have a great weekend!
Thanks!

Hi, Name,

I hope your day is going amazing! Recently, I came across a job posting at (company name). Before I apply to the black resume hole I wanted to see if you would get a referral bonus as an internal employee? If you do, I would love to set up a call to introduce myself and talk a little more about my interest in the role and your experience working at (company name). Is that something you would be up for?

In the event that you are, I have attached my resume so you can have an overview of my projects and previous work experience.

Thanks again for your time and I hope to have the opportunity to meet with you in the near future.

Have a great weekend!
Thanks!

Subject: What it is that you have in common

Hi, Name,

Happy Friday! I just sent you over a LinkedIn connection. It looks like we both insert commonality! I just graduated from App Academy here in SF! I saw that you work for company. I found a position you are hiring for via The Muse.com. I would love to chat with you about what it is like to work there.
