Hello Rachel!


Hope you're doing well. I saw this posting from Wellthy: [link] and after reading through the JD, I feel I would be a great fit on your team. I have experience with React, NoSQL, and Django, but as part of my bootcamp program, we also delved into Javascript, Python, and more.



I have a passion for learning new technologies and, thanks to my experience, have both learned and built with various tools in lightning-fast turnaround times. I know whatever technology Wellthy is exploring, I would love to be on that journey with you all.


If you have the time, here's my portfolio [link] which has a link to my resume as well. Would love to hop on a call and talk about the work at Wellthy and how I might contribute.


Thanks and chat soon!

Allie
